## Usage

The three buttons are the main functionality for this app. First, use the left button to hit a route which scrapes The Onion for news articles and throws them onto the page for you to view. From there, you can click a button which will send a post request to the database API, requesting that article be saved for future reference. You can then press the "View Saved Articles" button to take a look at all your saved articles.
